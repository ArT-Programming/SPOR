# SPOR
The application allows the user to connect a webcam and generate graphic patterns in where the camera detects change in pixels.  
It also allow the user to zoom and create a mask, which is very helpful for mapping projections to fit surfaces.

The installation SPOR was exhibited at SOL Festival Aalborg during the 20-21 and the 27-28 of march 2015. 
SPOR is a development from the 3. semester project "CREATivE Patterns" from the fall of 2014.

The code is made in AlloSystem using build in openCV library. To use OpenCV, find the allosystem directory in Terminal and type make allocv.
Everthing should be ready to go!
